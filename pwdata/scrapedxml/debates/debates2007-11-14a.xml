	<p pid="a.647.5/1">Before I answer Question 1, the whole House will want to join me in expressing sadness and sympathy for the family and friends of the seven family members, including five children, who perished in the fire in Omagh yesterday. I reassure all hon. Members that a full investigation will take place into the cause of that tragic event.</p>

	<p pid="a.647.6/2">I am deeply concerned that a young man in Northern Ireland was brutally beaten to death&#8212;every bone in his body broken&#8212;and that two policemen, one in Londonderry and one in Dungannon, have been shot and badly wounded. Does not that indicate that sectarian crime is rearing its ugly head again? Is not it important that the Administration in Stormont act fiercely against such crime? What are the Government doing to help the coalition Administration in Northern Ireland overcome sectarianism, which appears to be raising its head again?</p>
