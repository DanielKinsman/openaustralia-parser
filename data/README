This directory contains hand-made data. Currently it is only being used for the house of representatives members
information which (hopefully) doesn't change too often. It was unfortunately more straightforward to build this
by hand rather than writing a parser for it.

house_members.csv:
Contains the members of the House of Representatives since 1980. This data was originaly taken from 41st parliamentary
handbook available at http://www.aph.gov.au/library/handbook41st/historical/representatives/index.htm
