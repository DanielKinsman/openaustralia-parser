How to Install

Assumptions

These steps have only been tested on Mac OS X 10.5 (leopard). They might
work as well on other Unix derivatives.

Requirements

Unix
Apache + PHP + MySQL
(we've tested with Apache 2.X.X, PHP5, MySQL 5.0.x)
Ruby (Leopard comes with Ruby)

rubygems
mechanize
builder
RMagick (this has dependencies like GraphicsMagick, which in turn needs
ghostscript, so you are better off get DarwinPorts and then installing
it with "sudo port install ghostscript" -NOTE: this step might take a while)

Mercurial (distributed source control management)

How to install all the previous apps

Apache, PHP and Ruby all come with Leopard. If you need to install any of these
on Mac OS X (if for whatever reason you don't have them installed) there's a ton
of information online:
