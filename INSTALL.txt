h1. How to Install

h2. Assumptions

These steps have only been tested on Mac OS X 10.5 (leopard). They might work as well on other Unix derivatives.

h2. Requirements

*  Unix
*  Apache + PHP + MySQL (we've tested with Apache 2.X.X, PHP5, MySQL 5.0.x)
*  Ruby (included in Leopard)
*  the following gems
**  mechanize
**  builder
**  RMagick 
   (this has dependencies like GraphicsMagick, which in turn needs
   ghostscript)
**  rcov
*  "Mercurial":http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/

h2. How to install all the previous apps

Apache, PHP and Ruby all come with Leopard. If you need to install any of these
on Mac OS X (if for whatever reason you don't have them installed) there's a ton
of information online:

# "Entropy's Instructions":http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/
# "Hivelogic's Instructions":http://hivelogic.com/articles/ruby_rails_lighttpd_mysql_tiger/

Install "DarwinPorts":http://darwinports.com/ and then install Mercurial, ImageMagick and ghostscript:

<pre>
  <code>
$ sudo port install mercurial
$ sudo port install ImageMagick
$ sudo port install ghostscript
  </code>
</pre>

h2. Installing OpenAustralia

h3. Web Application

For development purposes we have our web application (mostly PHP) under
<tt>/Library/WebServer/Documents/</tt> and, unless you want to patch the
configuration, we recommend that you install it there.


<pre>
  <code>
$ cd /Library/WebServer/
$ sudo chown -R YOURUSER:staff Documents
(enter your admin password)
$ cd Documents
$ mkdir openaustralia
$ hg clone http://hg.assembla.com/openaustralia3 openaustralia-app
$ hg clone http://hg.assembla.com/openaustralia2 openaustralia-app/.hg/patches
  </code>
</pre>

Perl CPAN modules (for twfy XML parser):
sudo perl -MCPAN -e shell
cpan> install Error
cpan> install XML::Twig
cpan> install DBD::mysql
